    "# The Building Blocks of Configuration Management\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What are Domain-Specific Languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 DSL's compared to General Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we've seen examples of very simple Puppet rules they just define whiner more resources. These resources are the building blocks of Puppet rules, but we can do much more complex operations using Puppet's domain specific language or DSL. Typical programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java or Go are general purpose languages that can be used to write lots of different applications with different goals and use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, a **domain specific language** *is a programming language that's more limited in scope.* Learning a domain-specific language is usually much faster and easier than learning a general purpose programming language because there's a lot less to cover. You don't need to learn as much syntax or understand as many keywords or taking to account a lot of overhead in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Puppet, the DSL is limited to operations related to when and how to apply configuration management rules to our devices. For example, we can use the mechanisms provided by the DSL to set different values on laptops or desktop computers, or to install some specific packages only on the company's web servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 What DSL's Contain\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the basic resource types that we already checked out, Puppet's DSL includes variables, conditional statements, and functions. Using them, we can apply different resources or set attributes to different values depending on some conditions. Before we jump into an example of what that looks like, let's talk a bit about Puppet facts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Facts** *are variables that represent the characteristics of the system.* When the Puppet agent runs, it calls a program called factor which analyzes the current system, storing the information it gathers in these facts. Once it's done, it sends the values for these facts to the server, which uses them to calculate the rules that should be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Puppet comes with a bunch of baked-in core facts that store useful information about the system like what the current OS is, how much memory the computer has whether it's a virtual machine or not or what the current IP address is. If the information we need to make a decision isn't available through one of these facts, we can also write a script that checks for the information and turns it into our own custom fact. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check out an example of a piece of Puppet code that makes use of one of the built-in facts. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img8](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-1-Intro-to-Automation-at-Scale/img/img8.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "This piece of code is using the is-virtual fact together with a conditional statement to decide whether the smartmontools package should be installed or purged. This package is used for monitoring the state of hard drives using smart. So it's useful to have it installed in physical machines, but it doesn't make much sense to install it in our virtual machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see several of the characteristics of Puppets domain specific language in this block. So let's spend a little time looking at all of the elements of syntax here. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, `facts` is a variable. All variable names are preceded by a dollar sign in Puppet's DSL. In particular, the facts variable is what's known as a hash in the Puppet DSL, which is equivalent to a dictionary in Python. This means that we can access the different elements in the hash using their keys. In this case, we're accessing the value associated to the is virtual key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we see how we can write a conditional statement using if else, enclosing each block of the conditional with curly braces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each conditional block contains a package resource. We've seen resources before, but we haven't looked at the syntax in detail. So let's do that now. Every resource starts with the type of resource being defined. In this case, package and the contents of the resource are then enclosed in curly braces. Inside the resource definition, the first line contains the title followed by a colon. Any lines after that are attributes that are being set. We use equals greater than to assign values to the attributes and then each attribute ends with a comma. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've now covered a large chunk of puppet's DSL syntax. If you look back to what it was like to learn your first programming language, you'll probably notice how much less syntax there is to learn here. That's typical of the domain specific languages used by configuration management tools. While each tool uses their own DSL, they're usually very simple and can be learned very quickly. Up next, we'll talk about a few other principles behind most configuration management tools. Whenever you're ready, let's dive in."

    "## 2. The Driving Principles of Configuration Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, we've seen a few examples of what Puppet rules look like, including a bunch of different resources and even a conditional expression. You might have noticed that in all the examples we've checked out, we were never telling the computer the steps it should follow in order to do what we wanted. Instead, we were just declaring the end goal that we wanted to achieve, like going to a drive-through and ordering a burger, we didn't make it, but there it is. The providers that we mentioned earlier lake apt and yum are the ones in charge of turning our goals into whatever actions are necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "We say that Puppet uses a declarative language because we declare the state that we want to achieve rather than the steps to get there. Traditional languages like Python or C are called procedural because we write out the procedure that the computer needs to follow to reach our desired goal. Coming from a procedural language like Python, it might take some time to get used to writing declarative code like the ones used for Puppet, and that's okay. Just remember that when it comes to configuration management, it makes sense to simply state what the configuration should be, not what the computer should do to get there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you're using a resource to declare that you want a package installed, you don't care what commands a computer has to run you install it, you only care that after the configuration management tool has run, the package is installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of configuration management is that operations should be idempotent. In this context, an **idempotent action** *can be performed over and over again without changing the system after the first time the action was performed, and with no unintended side effects.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check this out with an example of a file resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img9](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-1-Intro-to-Automation-at-Scale/img/img9.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "This resource ensures that the /etc/issue file has a set of permissions and a specific line in it. Fulfilling this requirement is an idempotent operation. If the file already exists and has the desired content, then Puppet will understand that no action has to be taken. If the file doesn't exist, then puppet will create it. If the contents or permissions don't match, Puppet will fix them. No matter how many times the agent applies the rule, the end result is that this file will have the requested contents and permissions. Idempotency is a valuable property of any piece of automation. If a script is idempotent, it means that it can fail halfway through its task and be run again without problematic consequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you're running your configuration management system to setup a new server. Unfortunately, the setup fails because you forgot to add a second disk to the computer and the configuration required two disks. If your automation is idempotent, you can add the missing disk and then have the system pick up from where it left off. Most Puppet resources provide idempotent actions, and we can rest assured that two runs of the same set of rules will lead to the same end result. An exception to this is the `exec` resource, which runs commands for us. The actions taken by the exec resource might not be idempotent since a command might modify the system each time it's executed. To understand this, let's check out what happens when we execute a command that moves a file on our computer. First, we'll check that the example.txt file is here, and then we'll move it to the desktop directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img10](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-1-Intro-to-Automation-at-Scale/img/img10.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "This works fine now, but what happens if we run the exact same command again after it's been executed once? We receive an error because the file is no longer in the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img11](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-1-Intro-to-Automation-at-Scale/img/img11.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, this was not an idempotent action, as executing the same action twice produced a different result and the unintended side effect of an error. If we were running this inside Puppet, this would cause our Puppet run to finish with an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we need to use the exec resource to run a command for us, we need to be careful to ensure that the action is idempotent. We could do that for example by using the `onlyif` attribute like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img12](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-1-Intro-to-Automation-at-Scale/img/img12.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the onlyif attribute, we specified that this command should be executed only if the file that we want to move exists. This means that the file will be moved if it exists and nothing will happen if it doesn't. By adding this conditional, we've taken an action that's not idempotent and turned it into an idempotent one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of how configuration management works is the **test and repair paradigm.** This means that actions are taken only when they are necessary to achieve a goal. Puppet will first test to see if the resource being managed like a file or a package, actually needs to be modified. If the file exists in the place we want it to, no action needs to be taken. If a package is already installed, there's no need to install it again. This avoids wasting time doing actions that aren't needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another important characteristic is that Puppet is **stateless,** this means that there's no state being kept between runs of the agent. Each Puppet run is independent of the previous one, and the next one. Each time the puppet agent runs, it collects the current facts. The Puppet master generates the rules based just on those facts, and then the agent applies them as necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're just getting started with what configuration management is and what it looks like in Puppet. But hopefully, you're starting to see how understanding these basic concepts and how turning them into practical rules can help you manage a small army of computers. Up next, there's a reading with links to more information about the concepts we've covered followed by a quick quiz. You've got this."
