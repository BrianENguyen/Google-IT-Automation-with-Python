    "## 1. Intro to Module 2: Deploying Puppet\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back, congrats on making it through the first lab of the course. In the last module, we looked into some basic configuration management concepts, and what those look like in Puppet. In this module, we're going to dive deeper into how to use these tools. We'll kick off with how to install Puppet on your computer and how to use a simple test setup to check your rules work as expected. This test setup will let you try out the examples in these videos on your own computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also show you how to configure the typical client-server set-up with Puppet clients connecting and authenticating to the Puppet server to get the rules that they should apply and on top of this, we'll talk about how to use testing techniques and releasing best practices to safely deploy changes to clients of our configuration management system. \n",
    "\n",
    "You've already learned the basics of Puppet resources. We've seen the three most important resources, packages, files, and services. In this module, we'll check out more ways of using the basic resources and Puppet's DSL. We'll look into how you can apply different sets of rules to different nodes in your fleet, how you can organize your rules so that they're easier to maintain, and a bunch of other Puppet best-practices. We'll wrap up with another lab exercise. This time though, you'll be flexing your Puppet skills to manage the deployment and pulling the strings to make the system do what you want. Ready? Let's dive in."
